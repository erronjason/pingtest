#Connection status logger

My internet connection was up and down constantly, but seemingly never when I call my ISP. So this thing happened.

## Usage

Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), then simply run `vagrant up` in the directory.

Upon startup, the script will begin logging to status.log in the main directory.
